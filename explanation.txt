Put your Project 5 brief explanation, as directed, here.

I am accessing the Tumblr API. I wish to obtain the following info from five blogs:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Number of posts
  - URL
  - Posts
  - Post type
  - Post url

I will write one CSV file containing the following columns:
  - title (blog title)
  - description (blog description)
  - num_posts (number of posts user has made on blog)
  - url (blog url)

  To get this information I will use Tumblr's /info method.

I will write another CSV file containing the following columns:
  - blog (blog title)
  - post_type (for the blog's last 20 posts)
  - summary (for the blog's last 20 posts)
  - post_url (for the blog's last 20 posts)

  To get this information I will use Tumblr's /posts method.
